Here is the algorithms I implemented in the week 1 of Algorithms course by Robert Sedgewick and Kevin Wayne.

All the algorithms are under their specified file. I have used the catch testing suite, to test my implementations.

To run the test cases execute the following command.

```

g++ test.cpp -D filename

```
